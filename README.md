## Quick Start

    git clone git@github.com:b4sith-sec/VulnDroid.git
    cd VulnDroid
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

Launch the app, work through each lab, capture flags, and submit them on the in-app CTF scoreboard.

## Lab Categories

| Category | Vulnerabilities | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| WebView | WV-01 to WV-05 | 5 |
| Deeplink | DL-01 to DL-04, DL-CHAIN | 5 |
| Auth / SQL Injection | SQL-01 | 1 |
| Admin Panel | AP-01 to AP-03 | (covered by AP-01) |
| Broadcast Receiver | BR-01 to BR-03 | 2 |
| Service | SV-01, SV-02a, SV-02b | 2 |
| Network Interception | NET-01 | 1 |
| Banking / OTP | OTP-01 | 1 |
| LFI | LFI-01 | 1 |
| Storage | STORE-01 | 1 |

18 flags total, plus a master flag awarded for capturing all of them.

## CTF Flow

1. Open the app - lands directly on the lab list.
2. Pick a lab, exploit the vulnerability (via UI, ADB, or both).
3. Each successful exploit auto-captures its flag.
4. Tap "Submit Flag" to confirm, or check progress on "CTF Scoreboard".
5. Capture all 18 flags to unlock the master flag.
